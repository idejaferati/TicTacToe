# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript and the p5.js library. The game allows you to play against the computer or against another player. It uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the computer's moves.

## Game Features
- Play against the computer or against another player.
- Interactive gameplay using mouse clicks.
- Option to restart the game.
- Game status displayed after each player's turn and game results.

## Installation
To run the game locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. The game should now be running, and you can start playing Tic Tac Toe.

## Usage
Once the game is running, the board will be displayed on the screen. The current player's turn will be displayed in the game area. To make a move, click on an empty cell on the board. The game will update the board and switch to the next player's turn. Play continues until one player wins, there is a tie, or the game is restarted. To restart the game, click the "Restart game" button. To switch between playing with the computer or another player, toggle the "Play with Computer" switch.

## Game Logic
The game logic is implemented in the game.js file. It uses a two-dimensional array to represent the game board and checks for winning conditions by examining rows, columns, and diagonals. The minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning is used to determine the computer's moves when playing against the computer.

## Dependencies
The game uses the following dependencies:
- p5.js: A JavaScript library for creative coding and interactive graphics.

The dependencies are included via CDN links in the index.html file, so an internet connection is required to run the game.

## Credits
- The p5.js library is developed and maintained by the Processing Foundation.
